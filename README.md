# PythonLearningProjects

Just a bunch of projects to get used to Python based on the [http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/](exercises of Martyr2).
Each exercise will have its rules provided in the Python file.
If the exercise needs multiple files, a folder will be created for it.

There's multiple categories, such as :
- Text
- Numbers
- Networking
- Classes
- Threading
- Web
- Files
- Databases
- Graphics & Multimedia
- Games

I won't do every exercise, I won't do them following the provided order, and I am not even sure I'll be able to properly do all of them ( according to the language possibilities ).

I will update this Repo whenever I feel it, and I will probably do that with many languages in order to learn them.

Feel free to suggest me anything, even more exercises !
