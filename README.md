# PythonLearningProjects

Just a bunch of projects to get used to Python based on the [exercises of Martyr2](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/).
Each exercise will have its rules provided in the Python file.
If the exercise needs multiple files, a folder will be created for it.

There's multiple categories, such as :
- Text
- Numbers
- Networking
- Classes
- Threading
- Web
- Files
- Databases
- Graphics & Multimedia
- Games

Moreover, I will do as many [r/dailyprogrammer challenges](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges) as I can. These will be in another folder, appart from the Martyr2's exercises.

I won't do every exercise or challenge, I won't do them following the provided order, and I am not even sure I'll be able to properly do all of them ( according to the language possibilities ). But I will do my best to learn Python, and I will name the files / folders according to the exercise I'm doing.

I will update this Repo whenever I feel it, and I will probably do that with many languages in order to learn them.

Feel free to suggest me anything or to blame me, I'd love to have feedbacks !
