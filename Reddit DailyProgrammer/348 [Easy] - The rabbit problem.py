Exercise 348 [Easy] - The Rabbits problem - NOT WORKING PROPERLY !
https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/7s888w/20180122_challenge_348_easy_the_rabbit_problem/

Starting with a small population of male and female rabbits
We have to figure out how long it will take for them to outnumber humans 2:1.
Every month a fertile female will have 14 offspring (5 males and 9 females).
A female rabbit is fertile when it has reached the age of 4 months, they never stop being fertile.
Rabbits die at the age of 8 years (96 months).
